Introduction

To upload a Newton package to your favorite MessagePad, you need a Newton
Package Installer. The package installer supplied by Apple only supports
MacOS and Windows. For Linux/UN*X users, there is no easy way to install
packages without booting into Windows or MacOS.

To enable a user to upload Newton packages under a Linux environment, you can
use some communication packages, but these programs cannot give good uploading
speed. Therefore UnixNPI was developed for Linux and ported to other UN*X
platforms.

The advantages to UnixNPI is that you do not need to have a seperate
communication package inside your Newton MessagePad. It uses the built in
package uploading protocol for uploading. The time needed to upload a
package will be the same as your Windows or MacOS Package Installer, which
is much faster than using other communication packages.
