Introduction

To upload a Newton package to your favorite MessagePad, you need a Newton
Package Installer. The package installer supplied by Apple can only support
MacOS and Windows. For Linux users, installing a Newton package is rather
clumsy, you need to reboot your machine to startup Windows and reboot again
after you have finished.

To enable a user to upload Newton packages under a Linux environment, you can
use some communication packages, but these programs cannot give good uploading
speed. Therefore I intended to develope a Newton Package Uploader for Linux
environment which target for speed and simple. Also, the package uploader will
be ported to varies Unix platforms to benifit others Unix users.

The advantages to use the UnixNPI is that you do not need to have a
communication package inside your Newton MessagePad. It uses the built in
package uploading protocol for uploading. The time need to upload a package
will be the same as your Windows or MacOS Package Installer, which is much
faster than using other communication packages.
