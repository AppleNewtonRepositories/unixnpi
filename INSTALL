Requirements:

- a C compiler
- C standard library
- POSIX compatible headers
- a serial port device connected to a NewtonOS device (any OS version)

1)  Compile the program: 'make' should be all that is necessary.

2)  [Optional] As root, create a symlink from the appropriate serial port
device to /dev/newton (eg. 'ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/newton')

3)  Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read/write to the 
serial port.

4)  Run UnixNPI.  If you don't specify the -d or -s options, the program
will default to /dev/newton for the serial device and 38400bps for the
port speed.

5)  [Optional]  If you uncompress one of the packages in the NewtonOS/
directory and install it to your Newton, you will be able to install
packages at a faster speed.  57600bps is supported by all devices.
115200 and 230400 bps speeds require NewtonOS 2.x.

That's all!  You can copy the unixnpi binary anywhere in your path you 
like.
