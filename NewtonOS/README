These are installable NewtonOS packages to enable faster serial communications
speeds when using the built-in "Connection" or "Dock" tool.

Installing them will add a new connection option, with the supported speed
(in bits per second) to the "Connection" or "Dock" tool on your NewtonOS
device.

These packages were created by the original author of UnixNPI, Richard C.L. Li

The files have been compressed with GZip; you must uncompress them before
installing them on a NewtonOS device.

Source code is included; the packages were written on a Newton using Steve
Weyer's NewtDevEnv (http://communicrossings.com/html/newton/newtdev.htm)
