1.1.3:
- Added batch uploading capability (Victor R.)
- Removed the need for a $HOME/.unixnpi.rc file - now reads serial speed 
from the command line (defaults to 38400) and requires the existence of 
/dev/newton (symlink it to the appropriate serial device)

- fixed registration removal - now actually works, and cleaner too! 
(Victor R. and Dakkar <ceccarel@cibs.sns.it>)

now completely unnecessary)
- created INSTALL file
- created this (CHANGELOG) file
- fixed COPYING file
