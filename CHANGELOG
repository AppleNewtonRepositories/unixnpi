1.1.4:
- Changed Makefile to use cc by default instead of gcc

  <hendrik.lipka@gmx.de>)

1.1.3:
- Added batch uploading capability (Victor R.)
- Removed the need for a $HOME/.unixnpi.rc file - now reads serial speed

/dev/newton (symlink it to the appropriate serial device)

(Victor R. and Dakkar <ceccarel@cibs.sns.it>)

now completely unnecessary)
